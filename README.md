# skript-codespace
Skript specific development platform, allowing to execute code in real time in order to receive a result in a console.
This will be based on the skript-parser project, allowing Skript code to be executed outside Minecraft servers.
We will use Symfony and probably Spring to create an intermediary with Java that will return the result of the executed code.
Different functionalities will be added: code sharing, real-time editing with collaborators, support for different add-ons... and more!

The beginning of the development of this project is subject to the progress of the other personal projects, but should start around **January 2021**.
